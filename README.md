# Assessing introspective linguistic judgments quantitatively

The experimental materials, data, and reproducible code for "Assessing introspective linguistic judgments quantitatively: The case of The Syntax of Chinese" in Journal of East Asian Linguistics


In this work, we employed formal quantitative methods to evaluate the reliability of judgments in the widely used textbook, The Syntax of Chinese (Huang, Li, & Li, 2009). We first assessed example sentences based on the acceptability ratings from 148 native Mandarin Chinese speakers. Using a target forced-choice task, we further explored the potentially problematic sentence pairs. Results of the two experiments suggest an eminently successful replication of judgments in the book: out of the 557 data samples tested, only five sentence pairs require further investigation. This large-scale study represents the first attempt to replicate the judgments in a non-English syntax textbook, in hopes to bridge the gap between the informal data-collection in Chinese linguistic research and the protocols of experimental cognitive science.
